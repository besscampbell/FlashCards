Function: A function is a block of code that performs an action and returns a result; optionally takes arguments

Comment: anything following // on a line in JavaScript is ignored by the computer. Comments are a convenient way to leave notes in your code for yourself or other programmers.

Argument: what you pass into a function or method.

Parameter: a variable that's assigned to the argument.

Calling a Function: Executing a function on something.

Return: The result provided by an executed function.

Business logic: The code responsible for handling the evaluation and manipulation of data; does not require any user interface.

User interface logic: The code responsible for the interaction between the user and the application; handles tasks such as event listening, user input forms, DOM manipulation, display and styling.

JavaScript: a programming language used to make web pages interactive. 

jQuery: a JavaScript library that makes it easier to incorporate JavaScript on your web pages.

Number: All numbers such as 221, -4, or 1.97. This is a type of "primitive."

String: A string is a set of characters enclosed in quotations. "hello" is an example. This is a type of "primitive."

Boolean: A boolean is either true or false. This is a type of "primitive."

Null: Null is nothing. This is a type of "primitive."

Undefined: This means something hasn't been defined in our code yet. This is a type of "primitive."

Primitive: A simple element that can't change. JavaScript has six types of primitives.

Operator: A special character (or characters) that indicates an action to be performed. +, -, *, /, and % are all operators.

NaN: Stands for "not a number". NaN is considered a type of number.

Variable: Stored information. They allow for a way to label data with a descriptive name.

Variable naming conventions: The one we use is called "lower camel case." In this, all words are written with the starting letter capitalized, and with no spaces between them. However, the first letter is always lowercase. For example, "lower camel case" would be lowerCamelCase.
